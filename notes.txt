Choose a player in the cell that meets the row and column criteria
The player must have played at least one regular season NHL game for the team to be counted
If a cell is for an award/stat and a team, the player must have recorded the award/stat while on that team that season
Players and stats follow the franchise when relocated. This means that players like Kovalchuk count for present day Winnipeg Jets
Teams that have been moved back under the same name do not count as the same team. 1990s Winnipeg Jets don't count as present day Jets
A player can only be used once
Once a player is chosen, the guess cannot be changed
Every guess counts as a shot, regardless of its correctness
If a player was traded mid-season for a stat and team category, either team is acceptable
Uniqueness is calculated from the sum of the percentages of each, plus 100 for every empty cell. The lower the score, the more rare each player pick was.
A new game is available every day
Player data is sourced from Stathead
This game is brand new and I work on it myself, please be patient as I add features and resolve issues
